                        <p>Has your studying moved online because of COVID-19? Are you looking to study courses that offer remote learning? The digital classroom is a great place to learn. Interest has shot up recently because of the pandemic, but it's always offered students a greater level of flexibility.</p>
                        <p>However, you do have to learn how to prioritize your studying. In this guide, as well as looking at which colleges offer online learning, we explore the importance of a good working encironment and how to embrace the right learning style at home.</p>
                        <h2>The rise of online study options</h2>
                        <p>Long gone are the days where you had to be sat at a desk in a classroom to learn. If lecture halls aren't right for you, then there's the option to study remotely. This means you won't meet your teachers or fellow students in a traditional classroom setting. Instead, all learning will be done online.</p>
                        <p>It means you can study in a more flexible way, and this has proved popular among many students. But how remote learning is implemented does vary. Most courses will be structured in a way that best suits the curriculum and professor's teaching style.</p>
                        <p>Teaching can be delivered synchronously or asynchronously:</p>

                            <div class="col-6">
                                <img src="assets/Group30.svg">
                                <h3>Synchronous learning</h3>
                                <p>The teacher, lecturer or professor is engaged with students in a specified time frame – during which everyone should be present. This type of virtual learning allows students to learn, participate and ask any questions in real time.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-6">

                                <h3>Asynchronous learning</h3>
                                <p>This refers to any learning which relies on course material which can be read, viewed or watched at any time. For example, a presentation narrated by the teacher but watched by students at all different times.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>However the teaching is delivered, students can learn from wherever they are. This is one of the greatest appeals of online learning. It can fit in with your lifestyle. Online learning can refer to platforms such as Udemy, Coursera, Lynda, Skillshare, or Udacity that deliver a huge variety of courses to millions of people. But universities – including top tier ones such as Stanford University and Harvard University – are also making their courses accessible online. It’s a huge catalyst for learning. It’s also a huge market opportunity. Before the pandemic, Research and Markets forecasted that the online education market would be worth $350 billion by 2025. And according to data published by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in 2019, 34.7% of all enrolled college students in the US took at least one online course in 2018. That was a 1.6% rise on the previous year. Students also have more choice than ever. Around 76% of degree-granting institutions offered online degree courses in 2016-17, compared to 70% in 2012, according to an American Enterprise Institution report. This number is predicted to continue growing.</p>

                            <div class="col-6">
                                <h1>70%</h1>
                                <p>Offered online degree courses in 2012</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-6">
                                <h1>76%</h1>
                                <p>Offered online degree courses in 2016-17</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>Arguably, higher education has been slow to adopt a more digitally-focused business model. But there’s a good reason for this. For a long time it was restricted by the “50 percent rule” of the Higher Education Act (HEA) of 1992. It prevented learning institutions from accessing federal funding if they offered predominantly or exclusively distance education programs – in other words, courses which are taught remotely. Across an institution, if more than 50% of their courses (or 50% of their students) were distance learning, then the whole college and every student wouldn’t be eligible for federal student aid programs. This included Pell Grants, subsidized loans, and work-study funding. Fortunately, the HEA was amended in 1998 to allow the Distance Education Demonstration Program (DEDP) to grant colleges waivers from the 50 percent rule. It was later amended again to discontinue the 50 percent rule in 2006. Now higher education institutions can generally offer online courses unrestricted by state or federal policies. And by 2030, technology is predicted to reshape the university experience – with 63% of leaders of prominent global universities expecting to offer full degrees online by 2030. What’s more, this data was collected before the coronavirus pandemic encouraged many industries to provide remote offerings more quickly than they had planned to.</p>
